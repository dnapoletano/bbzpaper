\noindent
We compute the total cross-section for $Z$ boson production in
bottom-quark fusion, applying to this case the method we previously
used for Higgs production in bottom fusion. Namely, we  match, through
the FONLL procedure,
the  next-to-next-to-leading-log five-flavor
scheme result, in which  the $b$~quark is
treated as a massless parton, with the next-to-leading-order
$\order{\alpha_s^3}$  
four-flavor scheme computation in which bottom is treated as a massive
final-state particle.
Also, we add to our formalism the possibility of varying the
heavy quark matching scale. 
The results obtained with the FONLL formalism can thus be compared
directly
 to recent results obtained in various approximations, and used as a
proxy 
to assess and discuss the issues of scale dependence and treatment of heavy
quarks.

The production of a $Z$ boson is one of the main standard candles at the LHC,
and is now measured at the sub-percent level. The main production mode
is through quark-anti-quark fusion, of which the bottom-initiated contribution
accounts to ${\cal O}(4\%)$ of the total cross section.
Being that a small but non negligible fraction of the total cross section,
its contribution affects both the normalisation and the shape
of the kinematic distributions and therefore a precise estimate of the
bottom-initiated contribution is important for precision physics, for
example in the determination of the $W$ mass~\cite{Bagnaschi:2018dnh}.
This process is thus an ideal test case for matched computations,
recently applied to Higgs production 
in bottom quark
fusion~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja,Bonvini:2015pxa,Bonvini:2016fgf}. As
we shall show here, it  provides a theoretically transparent setting
for the discussion of issues of  choice of scheme and scale in  the
treatment of heavy quark contributions.

Like any process involving bottom quarks at the matrix-element level, 
the bottom-initiated $Z$ production process 
may be computed using two different  factorisation schemes, which we
refer to, as usual, as four- and five-flavour schemes for short. In the
four-flavour scheme (4FS), the $b$~quark is treated as a massive
object, which 
decouples from QCD perturbative evolution. Calculations in this scheme
are thus performed by only including
the four lightest flavour together with the gluon  in evolution
equations for parton distributions (PDFs), and in the running of
$\alpha_s$,
so $n_f=4$ in the QCD $\beta$ function.
In the five-flavour scheme (5FS), instead, the $b$~ quark is treated on
the same footing as other light quark flavours, there is a $b$~PDF, and
$n_f=5$ in evolution equations for PDFs and in the QCD $\beta$ function.

In matched calculations, both scheme are combined, in such a way that
the result differs by that of each of the two schemes by terms which
are sub-leading with respect to the accuracy of either of them. Whereas
several matching schemes have been proposed and used in the past in
the context of deep-inelastic (DIS) or hadronic processes, the FONLL scheme,
first proposed for  heavy quark production in hadronic
collisions~\cite{Cacciari:1998it} has the advantage of being
universally applicable; also, it allows for the matching of
four- and five-flavour computations performed at any combination of
individual perturbative orders. It has been extended to deep-inelastic
scattering in Ref.~\cite{Forte:2010ta} (also
including~\cite{Ball:2015tna,Ball:2015dpa} the case in which the heavy
quark PDF is independently parametrised) and, as mentioned, it has
been
used in
Refs.~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja} for the computation of the
total cross-section for Higgs production in bottom
quark fusion.

Here, the methodology of
Refs.~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja} is applied to $Z$ production.
In the 5FS, the $Z$-production cross section has been known up to
next-to-next-to leading order
(NNLO) (i.e. $\order{\alpha_s^2}$) for almost three decades~\cite{Hamberg:1990np} and 
the heavy-quark initiated contribution has been specifically discussed
in 
several papers~\cite{Rijken:1995gi,Stelzer:1997ns,Maltoni:2005wd}.
%
The next-to-leading order (NLO) ($\order{\alpha_s^3}$) four-flavour scheme
$Zb\bar{b}$ production cross section was originally computed 
in Ref.~\cite{Campbell:2000bg} 
for exclusive 2-jet final states, neglecting the $b$~quark mass. 
The $b$-quark mass was subsequently fully included in
Refs.~\cite{FebresCordero:2008ci,Cordero:2009kv}.


In this work we combine these two results following the procedure we
presented in Refs.~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja} for the closely
related case of Higgs production: indeed, the counting of perturbative
orders for these two processes is the same, and many of the Feynman
diagrams are identical, with the only replacement of Higgs Yukawa
couplings with gauge couplings. Following the nomenclature introduced
in Ref.~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja}  (and originally in
Ref.~\cite{Forte:2010ta} for DIS) we have constructed an FONLL-A
result, which combines the NNLO 5FS with the LO  $\order{\alpha_s^2}$
4FS fully massive computation,  and an FONLL-B, where instead the NNLO
5FS is matched to the full  NLO $\order{\alpha_s^3}$ massive
results. 

Our construction is essentially identical to that of
Refs.~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja}, to which we refer for
details: it can be obtained from it by simply replacing the matrix elements
for Higgs production with those for gauge boson
production. Specifically, we have computed the 5FS NNLO 
cross-section using the 
code of Ref,~\cite{Maltoni:2005wd}, which we cross-checked both 
at LO and NLO against MG5\_aMC@NLO~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}. For the
massive 4FS LO and NLO we have also used  MG5\_aMC@NLO.
The construction of the FONLL matched results requires the computation
of the massless limit of the massive result:  we have implemented this
in the  public code~\cite{code} used in~\cite{Forte:2016sja}, in an
updated version soon to be made public.
All predictions are obtained using the NNLO NNPDF3.1 PDF 
set~\cite{Ball:2017nwa}. Lastly, PDF with varied thresholds
are obtained using the APFEL evolution library~\cite{Bertone:2013vaa}.
In order to be consistent with the PDF set used we take, in the 4F scheme,
the $b$ pole mass to be $m_b=4.92$~GeV, while the strong coupling
is run at NNLO, with $\alpha_s(m_Z) = 0.118$.

%% edit
A new feature  in comparison to
Refs.~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja},
is that we have now extended the formalism to allow for variation of
the scale $\mu_b$ at which the 4FS and 5FS schemes are matched.
In contrast,  in previous FONLL implementations, scale was fixed at
the  bottom mass:  $\mu_b=m_b$.
The reason why results depend on a matching scale is that in 
the 5FS the $b$~PDF is not independently
parametrised. Rather, it is assumed that it is radiatively generated
by the gluon. The matching scale is then the scale at which the $b$~PDF
is determined from the gluon. 
The interest in this is twofold. First,  it allows us
to perform  a direct comparison with recent work~\cite{Bertone:2017djs},
in which  he impact of varying the matching scale  is studied in the
5FS,  and in particular it is argued  that it might be
advantagous to choose a very large value $\mu_b\gg m_b$. 
Second, studying the effect  of matching scale variation provides us 
with another handle on the relative size of various contributions to
the matched calculation, which we will study explicitly.

The matching condition itself depends on
the matching scale in such a way that, at any given order,  results
are  independent of it up to sub-leading corrections. This dependence
persists in the FONLL matched results, but it is alleviated at
scales which are not too far from the bottom production threshold,
where the FONLL results almost reduces to the exact mass-dependent result in
which the physical threshold is implemented exactly. It reappears at
high-enough scales, where the FONLL result reduces to the 5FS, and it
only goes away when computing the matching condition to increasingly
high perturbative order, or by independently parametrising the heavy
quark PDF (indeed, this is the main motivation for independently
parametrising charm~\cite{Ball:2016neh,Ball:2017nwa}).

The generalisation of the FONLL matching formulae of
Refs.~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja} for a generic choice of
matching scale is given in the Appendix.
Dependence on this
matching scale for Higgs in bottom fusion  was studied explicitly in
Ref.~\cite{Bonvini:2015pxa,Bonvini:2016fgf}. The matching scheme of 
Ref.~\cite{Bonvini:2015pxa,Bonvini:2016fgf}, based on a EFT approach,
was benchmarked in Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz} to that of
Refs.~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja} and found to agree with it at
the percent level, hence a very similar dependence is expected for
FONLL.


Our results are summarised in
Figs.~\ref{fig:muR_var}-\ref{fig:m_mu_var}, where
matched results in the FONLL-A and FONLL-B scheme are compared to each
other and to the 4FS and 5FS scheme computations. Also, in
Table~\ref{tab:res}, results for the cross-section in the
three schemes with two different choices of central scale are
collected, with uncertainties obtained from
standard seven-point renormalization and factorization
scale variation. 


In the three plots
we study respectively the renormalisation, factorisation, and matching
scale dependence of the results. 
In each
case, renormalisation and factorisation scales are fixed, and then
varied about, either a high value $\mu=m_Z$, or a low value
$\mu_{R,F}=\frac{m_Z+2m_b}{3}$. While the higher scale choice is standard in
inclusive $W$ and $Z$ production, the lower choice was advocated in
Refs.~\cite{Maltoni:2012pa,Lim:2016wjo} based on arguments 
that it is closer to the physical hard scale of the process, which
correponds to the average transverse momentum of the emitted partons, 
and leads
to faster perturbative convergence. With this scale choice clearly the
4FS and 5FS are generally in better agreement.

Furthermore, in the case of our
preferred FONLL-B result, scale variation is performed in each case in
two different ways which differ by sub-leading terms, and the result is
shown as a band between these two choices with the central prediction
constructed as the  mid-point. The two possibilities correspond to the
observation (see e.g.~\cite{Altarelli:2008aj})
that scale variation by a factor $k$ 
of a quantity $F(\mu)$ which is scale-independent up to NLO but has a
NNLO scale dependence can be performed by either letting
\begin{equation}\label{eq:scalup}
  F(\mu_0;k)=F(\mu_0+\ln k)- \ln k \frac{d}{d\ln\mu}
  F(\mu)\Big|_{\mu_0=\mu_0+\ln k},
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}\label{eq:scaldown}
  F(\mu_0;k)=F(\mu_0+\ln k)- \ln k \frac{d}{d\ln\mu} F(\mu)\Big|_{\mu=\mu_0},
\end{equation}
where the first term on the r.h.s. is computed up to NLO, while the
second term may be computed up to LO, and thus the two expressions
differ by NNLO terms (and similarly for higher orders). The two
options define the two extremes of the band. The width of the band can
be viewed as the ambiguity, i.e. the scale uncertainty,
on the scale uncertainty itself.
Finally, matching scale variation is performed by varying it between the
default $\mu_b=m_b$ and $\mu_b=2m_b$.

We first describe and comment our
results, then discuss their interpretation, also in view of various
approximations which have been suggested in the literature. A first observation is that  comparison of
Figs.~\ref{fig:muR_var}-\ref{fig:muF_var} to the corresponding
plots for Higgs production in bottom fusion (Figs.~2-3 of
Ref.~\cite{Forte:2016sja}) show that they are qualitatively almost
indistinguishable: this is not unexpected given the similarity between
Higgs and $Z$ production which we already repeatedly emphasised. 

Coming now to these qualitative features we note that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The factorisation scale dependence is generally very slight,
  while the renormalisation scale dependence is, instead, stronger.
\item The scale dependence is quite large in the 4FS scheme, even at
  NLO though it is reduced in comparison to the LO case. It is much
  weaker in the 5FS and FONLL cases which all have similar and
  similarly weak scale dependence, except for very low values
  $\mu_R\sim \frac{m_Z}{10}$ where however the ambiguity on the scale
  uncertainty blows up. 
\item The perturbative expansion is  very
  unstable in the 4FS, with the LO and NLO results differing by a
  factor two or more. This instability is completely removed when the
  4FS is matched to the 5FS: indeed, the FONLL-A and FONLL-B are quite
  close to each other.
\item The 4FS and 5FS results are quite far from each other, with
  the 4FS NLO significantly
  closer to the 5FS than the LO. The FONLL results are in turn quite close to the 5FS.
\item The perturbative expansion is indeed more stable for a lower
  choice of factorisation and renormalisation scale. For very low
  scales $\mu\sim\frac{m_Z}{10}$ the 4FS and 5FS results become
  similar, but the scale dependence and its uncertainty (i.e. the
  slope of the curve, and the band about it) become very large.
\item A change of matching scale has essentially the same effect on
  the 5FS and the FONLL results, and it has the effect of moving both
  towards the 45S, though by a moderate amount.
\end{itemize}

These qualitative features have a simple theoretical
interpretation. To this purpose, note that the cross-section for
this process contains collinear logarithms regulated by the heavy
quark mass, i.e. powers of $\ln\frac{\mu_Z}{m_b^2}$, one at each
perturbative order. These logs  
arise from a transverse
momentum integration, whose the upper limit is the maximum value of the
transverse momentum, i.e. the hard scale of the process, 
which is proportional to but not equal to $m_Z$, and the lower limit
is the physical production threshold, which is proportional to but not
equal to $m_b$. Of course, one can always rewrite the ensuing
logarithm as  $\ln\frac{\mu_Z^2}{m_b^2}$, plus constants (i.e. terms
which only depend on the dimensionless ratio $\tau=\frac{\mu_z^2}{s}$),
and mass corrections (i.e. terms suppressed by powers of
$\frac{\mu^2_b}{m_Z^2}$). 

In the 4FS the result is exact, so whatever is not included in the log is included in
the constants or in the mass corrections; on the other hand at
N$^{k}$LO only the first $k+1$ logs are included. In the 5FS the logs are
rewritten as
$\ln\frac{\mu_Z^2}{m_b^2}=\ln\frac{\mu_Z^2}{\mu_F^2}+\ln\frac{\mu_F^2}{\mu_b^2}+\ln\frac{\mu_b^2}{m_b^2}
$, where $\mu_F$ is the factorisation  scale and 
$\mu_b$ is the matching scale. The logs of the factorisation scale 
$\ln\frac{\mu_F^2}{\mu_b^2}$ are then resummed to all orders into
the evolution of the PDF, while
the logs of the hard scale $\ln\frac{\mu_Z^2}{\mu_F^2}$ are included to
finite order in the hard partonic cross-section and
logs the matching scale, $\ln\frac{\mu_b^2}{m_b^2}$, are 
included to finite order in the matching condition, which
expresses the initial $b$~PDF in terms of the gluon (they would be 
implicitly included in the initial PDF
if the $b$~PDF were independently parametrised).
When varying the factorisation scale, logs at the upper end
of the evolution are reshuffled between the resummed PDF and the
fixed-order but exact hard cross-section. When varying the matching
scale, logs at the bottom end 
of the evolution are reshuffled between the resummed PDF and the
fixed-order but exact hard matching condition.

Note that both the
hard coefficient and the
matching condition contains logs and constants, but not
mass-suppressed terms: so in the 5FS constants and logs of the
matching scale, as well as constants and logs in the hard
coefficient, 
are treated exactly but to fixed order, while logs of the
factorisation scale are  resummed to all
orders, but neglecting constants. 
When the 5FS and the 4FS are matched into FONLL, also 
mass-suppressed terms, on top of constants
and logs of the matching scale, are treated
exactly.

The fact that the 4FS is perturbatively unstable while the 5FS is not
then is easily explained as a manifestation of the fact that the 4FS
contains large logs which are resummed in the 5FS. This is confirmed
by the fact that the large difference between the 4FS LO and NLO is of
the same order of the scale variation of the LO: indeed the scale
variation by construction captures the size of logarithmic
contribution. So the sizeable difference which persists between the 5FS
and NLO 4FS results is explained as being due to the higher order
(NNLO and beyond) logs
which are missing in the 4FS NLO, their size being quantitatively estimated
in ~\cite{Lim:2016wjo}. This is  confirmed by the observation
that the FONLL-A and FONLL-B include both the large log resummation,
and the full constants and mass suppressed terms, up to LO and NLO
respectively. The difference  between the FONLL-A and FONLL-B is thus
the size of the constant and mass-suppressed contributions to the
difference between the 4FS LO and NLO. This is seen to be much smaller
than the total difference between 4FS LO and NLO, which must therefore
be due to the log.

In order to further disentangle, within this small contribution, 
the constant from mass-suppressed term,
one would have to vary the hard scale, i.e. the $Z$ mass. This was
done in Ref.~\cite{Forte:2016sja} for Higgs production: variation of
the Higgs mass left the difference between FONLL-A and FONLL-B
essentially unchanged, thus showing that mass corrections are
negligible and the bulk of the difference between FONLL-A and FONLL-B
is due to a constant. Given the similarity between the two processes
we expect the same to be the case here. Given the small size of this
contribution the issue is largely academic anyway.

The qualitative form of the renormalisation scale dependence of the 4FS
result is also easy to understand: as the scale is decreased, the
value of $\alpha_s$ multiplying the large collinear log increases, and
both the LO and NLO predictions grow; this growth is only partly
reduced by the higher-order compensating term, at least down to
scales $\mu_R\sim 0.2\mu_Z$ where the ambiguity on the scale variation
itself becomes very large. The fact  that the 5FS (and FONLL) result
have almost no renormalisation scale dependence shows that this scale
dependence is coming from the $b$~quark term which is treated differently
between 4FS and 5FS.

The factorisation scale dependence is particularly intriguing. The
fact that this dependence is very slight in the 4FS is again consistent
with the observation that scale dependence is driven by the heavy
quark terms: in this scheme, in the absence of a $b$~PDF, the factorisation scale
dependence is  related to perturbative evolution of the light
quarks and gluons, which is moderate at NNLO. 
On the other hand, in the 5FS (and in FONLL) collinear logs are
resummed in the evolution  of the $b$-PDF up to $\mu_F$, and then
expanded out in the partonic cross-section from $\mu_F$ to the
physical hard scale of the process. We therefore expect the
factorisation scale dependence in this scheme to be approximately
stationary around this physical hard scale, very slight above it (where
$\alpha_s$ is small) and to only become significant when $\mu_F$ is
lower than the physical hard scale itself. This behaviour is
clearly seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:muF_var}, with the stationary point
close to the low scale advocated in Ref.~\cite{Maltoni:2012pa,Lim:2016wjo} 
that indeed this scale of the hard process, and it nicely explains the
very weak factorisation scale dependence also seen in the 5FS unless
$\mu_F\lesssim0.2m_Z$ or so.

Finally, the fact that when increasing the matching scale $\mu_b$ the
5FS and FONLL-B result decrease and get closer to the 4FS is
understood as a consequence of the fact that the resummed log becomes
smaller: clearly, if one were to choose $\mu_b=m_Z\sim 10 m_b$ the 5FS would
reduce to the 4FS one because the resummed logs then vanish. 
With the choice  $\mu_b= 2  m_b$ the FONLL and 5FS move towards the
the 4FS by an accordingly smaller amount.

We can finally discuss, in light of all this, the two related issues
of choosing the various scales, $\mu_F$, $\mu_R$ and $\mu_b$, and of
the validity of various approximations. As discussed, the scale
dependence of this process is driven by the collinear logs in the
$b$~ quark contribution, and thus the bulk of it comes from the
choice of argument in these logs. 

In a fully massive 4FS calculation,
these collinear logs are treated exactly, so the scale dependence
comes purely from the choice of argument in the strong coupling. It
then turns out that reducing the renormalisation scale increases the
4FS unresummed results up to the point where it agrees with the 5FS
resummed one. This is however accidental: the lack of resummation is made up
by artificially increasing $\alpha_s$, and indeed at low scale the
scale dependence of the 4FS result is not improved: if anything, it
increases. Hence, the 4FS appears to be a poor approximation to this
process and its improvement by lowering the renormalisation scale  is
unreliable.

In a 5FS calculation, instead, as mentioned, the exact upper and lower
limits of the transverse momentum integration are replaced by $\mu_F$
and $\mu_b$, respectively. As also mentioned, it has been
argued~\cite{Maltoni:2012pa,Lim:2016wjo} 
that the exact, kinematics-dependent upper limit of integration is
on average close to a scale $\frac{m_Z+2m_b}{3}\sim 0.35m_Z$. This is
borne out by our results: for all $\mu_F\gtrsim0.3m_Z$ the 
factorisation scale dependence of the 5FS result is flat, and with
this choice of $\mu_R$ the 5FS scale dependence is visibly
flatter. Given the smallness of mass
corrections, in practice a 5FS with low factorisation and
renormalisation scales appears to be a good approximation of the full
FONLL result.

On the other hand, it has been recently argued~\cite{Bertone:2017djs}
that a higher choice of matching scale may provide a better
approximation. Clearly, this is a process-dependent statement that
should be checked on a case-by-case basis: as discussed raising the
matching scale improves the accuracy of the starting, dynamically
generated PDF, as it matches it at a scale where perturbation theory
is more reliable, but it reduces the size of the logs which are
resummed. In the present case, the resummed logs are a large effect
and the constants a small correction, so raising the matching scale
does not appear to be advantageous: indeed, the renormalisation and
factorisation scale dependence is the same with $\mu_b=m_b$ or
$\mu_b=2m_b$, with no obvious improvement. 


In fact, when raising $\mu_b$
the 5FS result decreases, and moves towards the low 4FS, but with no
improvement in perturbative stability of the latter. This is to be
contrasted to the case in which $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ are lowered, which
also brings the 4FS and the 5FS closer but now towards a high value,
and with a visible increase in perturbative stability. In fact, the
FONLL result shows that exact inclusion of the mass corrections (most
likely the constant) increases the pure 5FS, by a small
amount. On the contrary, raising the matching scale lowers it: this
means that the deterioration of the log resummation is a larger effect
than the improvement made by starting the PDF at a scale at which
perturbation theory is more reliable.
So a 5FS with
large $\mu_b$ does not appear to be a better approximation in our case:
it is likely to be a worse approximation if  $\mu_b$ is raised by a
moderate amount,
and it definitely appears to be a poor approximation if $\mu_b$ is
raised up to the point at which the 5FS result reduces to the 4FS
one. On the other hand, a variation of $\mu_b$ by perhaps a factor
two, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:m_mu_var}, might well be a reasonable
estimate of the uncertainty due to the use of a fixed-order matching
condition and should be included in the theoretical uncertainty, as was
done in Refs.~\cite{Bonvini:2016fgf,deFlorian:2016spz}. This theoretical
uncertainty can only be removed by parametrising the $b$~PDF, in which
case it is  traded for a PDF uncertainty.

%

In summary, we have determined the total cross-section for $Z$
production in bottom quark fusion at the highest available accuracy in
a matched FONLL scheme, and we have used our results as a test case for the
discussion of issues of scale dependence and heavy quark treatment, by
generalising our previous results for Higgs production, and studying
not only renormalisation and factorisation scale, but also matching
scale dependence. 

Our main phenomenological conclusion is that,
similarly to the case of Higgs production,  mass effects are small,
but non-negligible in comparison to the high experimental accuracy to
which this process is measured. However, the contribution due to the
resummation of collinear logs of the heavy quark is sizeable, thereby
making a five-flavour scheme in which the $b$~quark is endowed with a PDF
a better approximation to the full FONLL result than the fixed-order
4FS calculation with massive b, which falls short of the full
prediction and displays large scale uncertainties. 

A low choice of
renormalisation and factorisation scale reduces the scale dependence
of both the full FONLL and pure 5FS result and is likely to improve
their accuracy, though in practice this makes little difference as the scale
dependence of both these results is very slight. However, it
does suggest that the hard physical scale for this process is
lower than the final-state mass, as previously advocated.
All in all, our results support the conclusion that a fully matched
treatment of heavy quarks with a proper inclusion of mass effects is
necessary for LHC phenomenology at the percent level, either through
its direct use, or as a guide to construct efficient and accurate
approximations.

  \section{FONLL expressions with $\mu_b$ different from $m_b$}
  \numberwithin{equation}{section}
  \setcounter{equation}{0}
  We give for completeness the FONLL expressions by using $m_b$ different from $\mu_b$.
  Note that the only difference with respect to the formulae presented in~\cite{Forte:2016sja},
  is in the logarithm obtained from the expansion of the $b$~PDF, where $L=\log(Q^2/m_b^2)$,
  becomes $L=\log(Q^2/\mu_b^2)$.

  With this modification in place we get, for the 4F scheme, $B$ coefficients:
  \begin{align}
    B_{gg}^{(2)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m^2_b}\right)        & = \hat{\sigma}_{gg}^{(2)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}\right) \\
    B_{q\bar{q}}^{(2)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m^2_b}\right) & = \hat{\sigma}_{q\bar{q}}^{(2)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}\right)
  \end{align}
  while at $\order{\alpha_s^3}$ the redefinition of $\alpha_s$ contributes:
  \begin{align}
    B_{gg}^{(3)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m^2_b},\frac{\mu_R^2}{\mu_b^2},\frac{\mu_F^2}{\mu_b^2}\right) & = \hat{\sigma}_{gg}^{(3)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}\right) - \frac{2 T_R}{3\pi} \ln{\frac{\mu_R^2}{\mu_F^2}}\hat{\sigma}_{gg}^{(2)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}\right)\\
    B_{q\bar{q}}^{(3)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m^2_b},\frac{\mu_R^2}{\mu_b^2},\frac{\mu_F^2}{\mu_b^2}\right) & = \hat{\sigma}_{q\bar{q}}^{(3)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}\right)- \frac{2 T_R}{3\pi} \ln{\frac{\mu_R^2}{\mu_b^2}}\hat{\sigma}_{q\bar{q}}^{(2)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}\right) \\
    B_{gq}^{(3)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m^2_b}\right)      & = \hat{\sigma}_{gq}^{(3)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}\right) \\
    B_{qg}^{(3)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m^2_b}\right)      & = \hat{\sigma}_{qg}^{(3)}\left(y,\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}\right).
  \end{align}

  The massless limit of the 4F scheme coefficients, $B^{(0)}$, are, in this case, given by
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:massless_lim}
    \sigma^{(4),(0)}\left(\alpha_s(Q^2),L\right)=\int_{\tau_H}^{1} \frac{dx}{x}\int_{\frac{\tau_H}{x}}^{1} \frac{dy}
          {y^2}\sum_{ij=q,g}f_{i}(x,Q^2)f_j\left(\frac{\tau_H}{x y},Q^2\right)B_{ij}^{(0)}\left(y,L,\alpha_s(Q^2)\right),
  \end{equation}
  with
  \begin{equation}
    B_{ij}^{(0)}\left(y,L,\alpha_s(Q^2)\right) = \sum_{p=2}^N\left(\alpha_s(Q^2)\right)^pB_{ij}^{(0),(p)}\left(y,L\right),
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{align}
    B_{gg}^{(0)(2)} (y,L) & = y\int_y^1\frac{dz}{z}\left[2\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(z,L\right)\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right) + 4\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right)\hat{\sigma}_{gb}^{(1)}(z)\right] + \hat{\sigma}_{gg}^{(2)}(y), \\
    B_{q\bar{q}}^{(0)(2)} (y,L) &= \hat{\sigma}_{q\bar{q}}^{(2)}(y);
  \end{align}
  while the new contributions to  $\order{\alpha_s^3}$ are
  \begin{align}\label{eq:subtrexp}
    B_{gg}^{(0)(3)} (y,L) & = y\int_y^1\frac{dz}{z}\left[4\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(2)}\left(z,L\right)\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right) + 2\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(z,L\right)\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(2)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right)\hat{\sigma}_{b\bar{b}}^{(1)}(z) \right.\nonumber \\
      & \left.\phantom{asdfdy\int_y^1\frac{dz}{z}4\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(2)}\left(z,L\right)}+ 4\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(2)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right)\hat{\sigma}_{gb}^{(1)}(z) + 4\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right)\hat{\sigma}_{gb}^{(2)}(z)\right], \\
    B_{gq}^{(0)(3)} (y,L)  & =  y\int_y^1\frac{dz}{z}\left[2\mathcal{A}_{\Sigma b}^{(2)}\left(z,L\right)\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right) + 2\mathcal{A}_{\Sigma b}^{(2)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right)\hat{\sigma}_{gb}^{(1)}(z) \right.\nonumber \\
      & \left.\phantom{asdfdy\int_y^1\frac{dz}{z}  4 \mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(2)}\left(z,L\right)\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right)\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right)}+ 2\mathcal{A}_{gb}^{(1)}\left(\frac{y}{z},L\right)\hat{\sigma}_{qb}^{(2)}(z)\right],
  \end{align}
  which completes our result in the case in which $\mu_b\neq m_b$.
